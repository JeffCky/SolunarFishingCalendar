SolunarFishing

My project will give a one day, 7 day or 30 day fishing forecast based
on the Solunar Theory.

The app will ask the user for a zipcode, date and whether they want a 
1, 7 or 30 day fishing forecast.  It will then access an api that takes 
the zip code and returns longitude and latitude.  Then it uses long, lat, 
and date to access another api that has solunar fishing data by date.  
The app will collect 1, 7 or 30 days of data and return this to user in a
pleasant usable format that shows the best hours and days to fish in 
that zipcode.
