SolunarFishing

This project will provide a one day, 7 day or 30 day fishing forecast based
on the Solunar Theory.

The app will ask the user for a zipcode, date and whether they want a 
1, 7 or 30 day fishing forecast.  It will then access an json file that uses linq 
to search on the zip code and returns longitude and latitude.  Then it uses longitude,  
latitude and date to access an api via the internet that has solunar fishing data by date.  
The app will collect 1, 7 or 30 days of data and return this to user in a
pleasant usable format that shows the best hours and days to fish for  
that zipcode.  


Project is uploaded to your GitHub repository and shows at minimum 5 separate commits.
Using GitHub’s file uploader on their website does not count as a check-in. You must upload via Git commands
Essentially, we need to see that you are using Git regularly as intended and not just waiting until your project is done to upload your final content
Note that committing and pushing 5 changes at one time is a single commit, not 5 separate commits.

Project includes a README file that explains the following:
A one paragraph or longer description of what your project is about
Which 3+ features you have included from the below list to meet the requirements
Any special instructions required for the reviewer to run your project.

You must create at least one class, then create at least one object of that class and populate it with data. You must use or display the data in your application.

Create and call at least 3 functions or methods, at least one of which must return a value that is used in your application.

Choose at least 3 items on the Features List below and implement them in your project
We recommend you pick a 4th item (or more!) to add, just in case something goes wrong with one of your other items - 3 is only the minimum requirement

Failure to meet all requirements will result in you not completing the class.
FEATURE LIST:
Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program
Create an additional class which inherits one or more properties from its parent
Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program
Implement a log that records errors, invalid inputs, or other important events and writes them to a text file
Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in your application
Implement a regular expression (regex) to ensure a field either a phone number or an email address is always stored and displayed in the same format
Connect to an external/3rd party API and read data into your app
Use a LINQ query to retrieve information from a data structure (such as a list or array) or file
Create 3 or more unit tests for your application
Build a conversion tool that converts user input to another type and displays it (ex: converts cups to grams)
Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event)
Analyze text and display information about it (ex: how many words in a paragraph)
Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data
Other features can be added to this list with mentor or staff permission, but we want to see you stretch your skills, so you’ll want to pick something challenging.
